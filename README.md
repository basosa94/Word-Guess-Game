# Word-Guess-Game
Homework 3

### DESCRIPTION
This project is a Pokemon themed Hangman game coded using
HTML, CSS and Javascript. For the design of the web page, Bootstrap was used and images found in the image folder were used for the background.

The javascript file was designed to help display on the html file:
1. Lives: (The number of guesses the user has to get word correct. The number of lives for each game is set to 10. Lives are reduced by 1 for each time an incorrect letter is given).
2. Wins: (# of times the user guesses word correctly).
3. Losses: (# of times the user fails to guess word correctly after going through all 10 lives).
4. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed,displayed like `A B C D`).
5. Another word after the user wins or loses the game.

The javascript files is broken down into four sections:
1. Defining variables
2. Defining Functions
3. Main Process

Each section contains pseudocode which explains what each is doing.
